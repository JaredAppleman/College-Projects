These were my final deliverables for my database class project. The database is for a library. 

Language: mySQL

jaredapp_library: database dump of all my tables

SQLstatements: a text file of a list of scenarios and methods for using my database.
ex) Scenario: get a list of Non-text rentals for inventory //laptops, dvd's, etc
SQL: select * from Rentals where not type = 'book' and not type = 'periodical';
