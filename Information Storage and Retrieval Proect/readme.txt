Description of project:
Gathers all of shakespears pieces from http://shakespeare.mit.edu. It creates a local file for each piece, a bigram index, and a term index. 

After everything is created, the main purpose of the program is to allow you to enter a word. The program then returns a list of shakespear's works that contains the word you entered.



Files Created:
Projects creates a text file for each piece of literature, a bigram index, and a term index. It creates almost 200 files due to the amount of work shakespear created.



Running Requirements:
This program uses some non-default libraries. You need requests, contextlib, bs4, nltk, json, os, and ast.
The only other requirement is to make sure the stopWords file is located within the same directory as the program.
I would recommend running this program in a folder, so all the created files are in the same place.
